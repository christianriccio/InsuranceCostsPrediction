# InsuranceCostsPrediction - iOS App 
This is an example app built on top of SwiftUI. 
The app allows the user to estimated amount of $ to pay for the insurance costs based on some feature, such as: 
- sex (either male or female)
- age 
- child: number of child 
- smoke: yes or no
- bmi (body mass index)

At the core of the predictions runs a simple model built with CreateML and trained on the data repository available at the following link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. 
The main idea of this simple app is to show how bring a ML model into an app with CoreML and makes predictions on the device. 
Also, SwithUI for the UI is used to try some cool stuff :) !
