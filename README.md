# InsuranceCostsPrediction - iOS App 
This is an example app built on top of SwiftUI. 
The app allows the user to estimated amount of $ to pay for the insurance costs based on some feature, such as: 
- sex (either male or female)
- age 
- child: number of child 
- smoke: yes or no
- bmi (body mass index)

At the core of the predictions runs a simple model built with CreateML and trained on the data repository available at the following link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. 
The main idea of this simple app is to show how bring a ML model into an app with CoreML and makes predictions on the device. 
Also, SwithUI for the UI is used to try some cool stuff :) !


# Usage
Feel free to use the app and take insipiration from this project (but please cite me somehow :) ). For any suggestion or curiosity or technical stuff feel free to reach me by:

To use the app download the whole project, open it with Xcode (v.13.0 +) and made the build on the iphone :D.

You will have a very lightweight and powerful ML model into your pocket ready to calculate the insurance costs you have to face due to some factors.
